### CLI

```
$ wt

Commands:
  wt fi [COMMENT]              # Short hand for *finish*
  wt finish [COMMENT]          # Finish working on current group.
  wt help [COMMAND]            # Describe available commands or one specific command
  wt st [COMMENT]              # Short hand for *start*
  wt start [COMMENT] <option>  # Start working with comment.
```

Start working with `wt start`.

```
$ wt start
```

You can set comment with it.

```
$ wt start "Today, I will implement some great feature!"
```

And also, you can specify group depends on your work type.
If you not specify group, WorkingTimes uses `DEFAULTWORK` on configuration.

```
$ wt start --work-on=remote1
$ wt start -w daily
```

Finish working with `wt finish`.
It ends **current** working so you have not to specify group.

```
$ wt finish
```

```
$ wt finish "What a sleepy day..."
```

Short hands are available.

```
$ wt st # same as 'wt start'
$ wt fi # same as 'wt finish'
```
